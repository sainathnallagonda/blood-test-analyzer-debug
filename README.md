# Blood Test Report Analyser

A FastAPI-based system for analyzing blood test reports using CrewAI, with background processing via Celery and Redis, and persistent storage of results in SQLite.

---

##  Bugs Found & How They Were Fixed

- **Import Errors:**
  - Fixed incorrect imports (e.g., `from crewai.agents import Agent` to `from crewai import Agent`).
  - Removed undefined imports (e.g., `search_tool`).
- **Task Validation Errors:**
  - Removed or fixed invalid `tools` arguments in Task definitions to resolve Pydantic validation errors.
- **Dependency Issues:**
  - Cleaned up `requirements.txt` to include only necessary packages.
  - Installed missing runtime dependencies (e.g., `python-multipart`).
- **FastAPI Server Startup:**
  - Removed `reload=True` from `uvicorn.run` in `main.py` for compatibility.
- **File Handling:**
  - Ensured uploaded files are saved with unique names and cleaned up after processing.
- **Celery Integration:**
  - Fixed argument passing to Celery tasks to ensure analysis results are saved in the database.
- **Database Integration:**
  - Added SQLAlchemy models and ensured results are stored and retrievable.

## üêõ Identified Bugs & Problems (Before Fixes)

1. ‚ùå Broken LLM Initialization in agents.py
   - **Problem:** `llm = llm` caused a NameError since `llm` was not defined before assignment.
   - **Fix:** Imported and initialized a valid LLM instance, e.g. `from langchain.llms import OpenAI; llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)`.

2. ‚ùå Missing Import in tools.py
   - **Problem:** `PDFLoader` was not imported, causing a NameError.
   - **Fix:** Added `from langchain.document_loaders import PDFLoader`.

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Incorrect Async Usage in BloodTestReportTool
   - **Problem:** Used `async def` inside a class without `self`, and not used asynchronously elsewhere.
   - **Fix:** Changed to a regular method: `def read_data_tool(self, path='data/sample.pdf'):`

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è File Path Parameter Not Passed Down
   - **Problem:** Uploaded PDF's `file_path` was not used by the agent/task.
   - **Fix:** Ensured `run_crew(query, file_path)` passes the correct file path to the Task or Tool.
